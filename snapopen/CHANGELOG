Version 1.3 (December 2009)
* Update the CHANGELOG, VERSION and fix the broken project url.
* Delete the old Snap menu. Now you can call the action by Search > Open a file by name ...
* Added a simple filter to search process, now all image files (png, jpg, jpeg, gif, psd) are ignored; 
  this improve a little the performance and avoid that gedit hangs when try to search into 
  folders (like /myapp/public/galleries/), also you'll get less useless files listed as available.
